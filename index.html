<p>Welcome to my website. This website will host audio files, tutorials, and resources for the visually impaired, such as NVDA add-ons. Right now, you can download just a couple NVDA add-ons directly on the site, or you can browse my full collection of files on OnwardCloud. You can also join my TeamTalk server. Enjoy!</p>
